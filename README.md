# CodeScanner

**Project Contributions** :-

The user can write and compile code anywhere/anytime.

One’s who have code written on paper don’t have to type it again on the machine to check the output.

Can verify any code snippet from notes

**Implementation Process** :-

The app uses our device’s camera to scan the code and converts it into editable text with the help of a model.

The editable text is previewed by the user for proofreading before sending it to a compiler for execution.

The compiler then executes the code and returns appropriate output.

It supports 6 languages:-

* python3
* java
* c
* cpp
* php
* ruby
